# ALM Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrate how to build and use data pipelines using DataJoint for Python.  As an example, we use the ALM-1 dataset from http://crcns.org/data-sets/motor-cortex/alm-1/

# Viewing the tutorial
The tutorial consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks, which can be correctly rendered through the Jupyter.org viewer: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mesoscale-activity-map/ALM-tutorial

# Setup

## Configure DataJoint

## Download the data
If you are populating the data from scratch, you will need to download the initial data from the CRNCS repository.
